## Welcome to the Public Skydel Custom Signal Github Repository!

With Custom Signal, users can create their own personalized signals and attach them to GNSS satellites, so that they are streamed alongside with regular GNSS signals.

This repository contains the Skydel Custom Signal Software Development Kit (SDK) and multiple examples.
